# Voting System Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the BCS Seattle voting system.

## Security Overview

The voting system implements multiple layers of security to ensure:
- Vote integrity and immutability
- User privacy and data protection
- Prevention of fraud and manipulation
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Secure access controls

## Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Votes Table Security

**Policy: "Users can view their own votes"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own votes" ON public.votes
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
- Users can only view their own voting records
- Prevents unauthorized access to other users' votes
- Maintains vote privacy while allowing personal vote verification

**Policy: "Users can insert votes during voting window"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert votes during voting window" ON public.votes
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = user_id AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.elections e 
      WHERE e.id = election_id 
      AND NOW() >= e.start_date 
      AND NOW() <= e.end_date
    )
  );
```
- Only authenticated users can vote
- Votes can only be submitted during active voting windows
- Users can only vote for themselves (prevents vote delegation/fraud)

### Initiatives Table Security

**Policy: "Anyone can view initiatives"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view initiatives" ON public.initiatives
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
- Public access to view ballot initiatives
- Transparency in voting options

**Policy: "Authenticated users can manage initiatives"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage initiatives" ON public.initiatives
  FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```
- Only authenticated users can create/modify initiatives
- Prevents anonymous manipulation of ballot content

### Vote Confirmations Table Security

**Policy: "Users can view their own confirmations"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own confirmations" ON public.vote_confirmations
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Policy: "Users can insert their own confirmations"**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own confirmations" ON public.vote_confirmations
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
- Users can only access their own vote confirmations
- Maintains privacy of confirmation codes and vote details

## Database Constraints

### Unique Constraints
- **unique_candidate_vote**: Prevents duplicate votes for the same candidate
- **unique_initiative_vote**: Prevents duplicate votes on the same initiative
- **unique_user_election_confirmation**: One confirmation per user per election

### Check Constraints
- **vote_type_check**: Ensures votes are either for candidates OR initiatives, not both
- Validates data integrity at the database level

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All votes linked to valid elections, candidates, and initiatives
- Cascading deletes maintain referential integrity
- Prevents orphaned vote records

## Audit Trail Implementation

### Vote Tracking
Every vote record includes:
- **voted_at**: Timestamp of vote submission
- **ip_address**: IP address of voter (for fraud detection)
- **user_agent**: Browser information (for security analysis)
- **confirmation_code**: Unique verification code

### Immutable Records
- Votes cannot be modified after submission
- No UPDATE or DELETE policies on votes table
- Complete voting history preserved

### Confirmation System
- Unique confirmation codes for each voting session
- Vote count verification
- Permanent record of voting participation

## Security Functions

### Vote Validation Functions

**user_has_voted_in_election(election_uuid, user_uuid)**
- Checks if user has already voted in specific election
- Prevents duplicate voting attempts
- Used in API validation

**user_has_active_membership(user_uuid)**
- Validates membership status for voting eligibility
- Can be bypassed with URL parameter for testing
- Ensures only eligible members can vote

**get_election_vote_count(election_uuid)**
- Returns voting statistics for security monitoring
- Tracks candidate votes, initiative votes, and unique voters
- Used for fraud detection and reporting

### Security Validation Functions

**find_orphaned_votes()**
- Identifies votes referencing non-existent records
- Data integrity monitoring
- Database health checks

**find_invalid_votes()**
- Finds votes violating business rules
- Identifies data corruption or manipulation attempts
- Automated data validation

**get_voting_security_stats(election_uuid)**
- Comprehensive security statistics
- Suspicious activity detection
- Voting pattern analysis

## API Security Measures

### Authentication Requirements
- All voting endpoints require user authentication
- JWT token validation through Supabase Auth
- Session-based security

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation of all vote submissions
- Candidate and initiative existence verification
- Position-based vote validation (one candidate per position)

### Rate Limiting Considerations
```typescript
// Recommended rate limiting (to be implemented at infrastructure level)
// - 1 vote submission per user per election (enforced by database)
// - API rate limiting: 10 requests per minute per user
// - IP-based rate limiting for anonymous endpoints
```

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Detailed logging for security analysis
- Graceful failure handling
